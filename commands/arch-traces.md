# /arch-traces — End-to-End Interaction Traces

To run traces the context should already have enough level of the understanding of the codebase. If codebase is structure is unknown output "to run traces run arch-summary and arch-intro first"

Identify every internal interface and submodule-level interaction defined within the codebase (excluding external packages). For each interface, follow its execution path end-to-end: what calls it, what it triggers, how data or state moves through the layers, and what outcomes it produces.

Document these flows at a high level, explaining what each interaction corresponds to, what it affects, and why it behaves that way.

Create one file per interaction trace under devdocs/archaeology/traces/ (e.g., trace_1.md, trace_2.md).
Base all analysis strictly on actual code behavior rather than names or assumptions.

Each trace file should have the following sections

Core sections:
  - Entry Point
  - Execution Path
  - Resource Management
  - Error Path
  - Performance Characteristics
  - Observable Effects
  - Why This Design

Assessment sections (each must include an ELI5 explanation, an Impact field, and a Robust Fixes / Best Practices field):
  - What feels incomplete
  - What feels vulnerable
  - What feels like bad design

  for each of the three Assessment sections, include these subsections:
      the issue itself
      an ELI5 (plain-language explanation)
      Impact of it to the codebase and overall logic
      Robust Fixes / Best Practices (how to address it properly)


### Output

Write trace files to `devdocs/archaeology/traces/` (create the directory if needed). If the folder already exists, overwrite all trace files completely — rewrite fresh, don't patch.
