and i have a question which should be tackled in detailed way later on. for now i am just focused on defining the question  
  better, \                                                             



devdocs is good, but different branches has different code and for example traces should be differ per branch or not?

or when should we update the devdocs? who? how we will know they are uptodate? 

one feature implementation can spread into multiple brnahces then what?

should we have process of merging devdocs (via LLMs) as well? would that solve issues?
